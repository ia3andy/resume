      Trained in the ancient arts of the Force, I showed early promise — until I ran
      ```
      git push --force  
      ```
      making Yoda’s lightsaber look like a rainbow. I was... *politely* shown the exit.
      Disgraced but not defeated, I embraced the dark side — and discovered my true destiny with Quarkus.
      Why stay restrained when you can wield the full power of the Quarkus Force?
